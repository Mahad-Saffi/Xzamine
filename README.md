# Xzamine

## Overview
**Xzamine** is a Legal Post Checker Chrome extension designed to analyze posts on X for compliance with Pakistanâ€™s **Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA)**. It leverages AI-powered sentiment and legal analysis using the Gemma3 model (locally via Ollama) and GPT-4o-mini (via OpenAI API) to provide real-time feedback on the legality and sentiment of posts, helping users identify potentially non-compliant content.

## Features
- **Real-Time Post Analysis**: Adds an "Analyze" button to each post on X, enabling users to check posts for compliance and sentiment with a single click.
- **Sentiment Feedback**: Displays the sentiment of the post (e.g., "Normal Post" or a PECA violation category like "Hate Speech (Sec 10A)") directly on the button after initial analysis.
- **Detailed Compliance Reports**: Provides a "Show Report" button after detailed analysis is received, opening a new tab with a comprehensive report including:
  - Post owner, username, and content.
  - Sentiment and confidence score.
  - Detailed analysis with probabilities for each PECA category, toxic score, cultural context, legal definitions, protected group analysis, and rationale.
- **Dynamic Integration**: Uses a MutationObserver to automatically detect and add analysis buttons to newly loaded posts on X.
- **Error Handling**: Displays error messages on the button if analysis fails, ensuring user feedback in all scenarios.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - **Languages**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - **Chrome Extension API**: Manifest V3, utilizing `chrome.runtime` for messaging and `chrome.tabs` for report display.
- **Backend**:
  - **Language**: Python
  - **Framework**: Flask, running on a local server (`http://127.0.0.1:3000`), defined in `server.py`.
  - **Task Queue**: Celery, with Redis as the message broker and result backend (configured in `xzamine.py`).
  - **Structure**:
    - `server.py`: Main Flask application script that defines API endpoints (`/data` for post analysis, `/task/:task_id` for polling detailed results).
    - `server/` (package):
      - `xzamine.py`: Core logic for post analysis, integrating Gemma3 (via `ChatOllama`) and GPT-4o-mini (via `ChatOpenAI`) for sentiment and legal compliance checks. Uses Celery for asynchronous detailed analysis.
      - `analysis_structured_output.py`: Defines Pydantic models (`SentimentResult` and `Analysis`) for structured output of sentiment and detailed analysis results.
      - `prompt.py`: Placeholder for prompt management (currently empty, but intended to manage prompts for AI models).
    - `.env`: Stores environment variables, such as the OpenAI API key, Celery broker URL, and model type (`MODEL_TYPE` to toggle between `openai` and `ollama`).
  - **AI Models**:
    - **Local**: Gemma3 (via `ChatOllama`, defaulting to `Gemma3`) for local sentiment and compliance analysis.
    - **External**: GPT-4o-mini (via `ChatOpenAI`) for enhanced natural language processing and legal analysis.
  - **Dependencies**:
    - `langchain-openai` and `langchain-ollama` for model integration.
    - `pydantic` for structured output parsing.
    - `flask-cors` for handling CORS in Flask.
- **Styling**: Custom CSS for buttons and report pages, with responsive design and visual feedback (e.g., color-coded sentiment indicators).

## How It Works
1. **Post Detection**: The extension scans X for post containers and appends an "Analyze" button to each post using a MutationObserver (`content.js`).
2. **Analysis Trigger**: Clicking the "Analyze" button sends post data (owner, username, text) to the background script (`background.js`).
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: The background script sends a POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/data`. The Flask backend (`server.py`) processes the request by invoking `invoke_sentiment` from `xzamine.py`, which uses either Gemma3 or GPT-4o-mini (based on `MODEL_TYPE`) to analyze the post, returning sentiment and confidence scores structured as a `SentimentResult` object.
4. **Button Update**: The "Analyze" button updates to display the sentiment (e.g., green for "Normal Post," red for PECA violations).
5. **Detailed Analysis**: The `/data` endpoint triggers a Celery task (`process_detailed_analysis` in `xzamine.py`) for detailed analysis, returning a `task_id`. The extension polls `http://127.0.0.1:3000/task/:task_id` to retrieve the results, which are processed by `invoke_detailed_analysis` and structured as an `Analysis` object, including probabilities for all PECA categories, toxic score, and compliance details.
6. **Report Display**: Once detailed analysis is complete, a "Show Report" button appears, allowing users to view a comprehensive report in a new tab (`content.js`).

## Future Enhancements
- Expand support to other social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram).
- Enhance UI/UX with more interactive elements and improved report visualizations.
- Integrate additional legal frameworks for broader compliance checking.
- Add support for batch analysis of multiple posts.
- Implement caching for frequently analyzed posts to improve performance.
